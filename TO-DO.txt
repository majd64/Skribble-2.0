To-do:
1. Add fill tool
2. Display currently selected colour and tool to artist
    3. Highlight selected thickness to artist
4. Fix points system -> bugs
5. Add mute/ un-mute button
6. Display the magic word to the artist in the status bar
7. Display the letter place holders to the guessers in the status bar
8. GUI kinda looks shit -> make it look better
9. Use better music and background

==========================================================================================
Possible To-do:
1. Add host commands (I.e. kicking, restarting game etc)
2. Either a) allow the artist to select between multiple words or 
	b) allow the artist to skip words (either cap the # of skips or add a skip 			penalty like point deduction)
3. Allow game to work over the internet

Bugs To-do:
1. For saving an image of the canvas and clearing that array
    a. When the array is cleared, part of the stroke is lost
        - the faster the artist was drawing, the larger stroke volume lost.
        - possible cause: the stroke is not drawn and thus is not included in the screen capture before the array is cleared
            - weird because the image is taken after iterating through the whole array, and the artists update to the list should happen after
            - possible solution: leave a buffer in the array. instead of clearing it, we could try leaving some components
    b. canvas gets cleared instead of drawing an updated image
        -artist sends updated array before players can take picture

2. Fix being able to draw outside of canvas 
    -Center of drawing circle cant go outside canvas, but the radius can

3. Fix player disconnecting issues 
    -i.e what happens if artist dips
    -server must reset and stay idle if everyone dips

4.Points system is very unbalanced and has a bug where sometimes it doesn't update somebodies score
    a. shouldn't get points if no one guesses correctly, it could incentivise players to draw nothing at all

5. Fix the end of round screen so that it doesn't clip player names/points after a few players
