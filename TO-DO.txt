To-do:
4. Fix points system -> bugs
5. Add a screen that displays how many points each player got (screen goes between rounds)
6. Display the magic word to the artist in the status bar
9. Use better music
==========================================================================================
Possible To-do:
1. Add host commands (I.e. kicking, restarting game etc)
2. Either a) allow the artist to select between multiple words or 
	b) allow the artist to skip words (either cap the # of skips or add a skip 			penalty like point deduction)
3. Allow game to work over the internet

==========================================================================================
Bugs To-do:
1. the canvas (which isnt being redrawn until the end of the round) sometimes turns grey.
    a. causes: rapidly moving the window back and forth, and moving the window off the desktop screen
    b. this also sometimes causes minor duplication of panels, lasts for about a second

2. Fix being able to draw outside of canvas 
    -Center of drawing circle cant go outside canvas, but the radius can

3. Fix player disconnecting issues 
    -i.e what happens if artist dips
    -server must reset and stay idle if everyone dips

4.Points system is very unbalanced and has a bug where sometimes it doesn't update somebodies score
    a. shouldn't get points if no one guesses correctly, it could incentivise players to draw nothing at all

5. Fix the end of round screen so that it doesn't clip player names/points after a few players

6. If a word has to many letters the letter space holders interfere with other UI elements or go off the screen
 - Limit to MAX 12 letters
