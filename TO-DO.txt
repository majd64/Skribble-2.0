To-do:
4. Fix points system -> bugs
5. Add a screen that displays how many points each player got (screen goes between rounds) --> isnt this already implemented? No I removed it cuz it was shit
6. Display the magic word to the artist in the status bar
9. Use better music
==========================================================================================
Possible To-do:
1. Add host commands (I.e. kicking, restarting game etc)
2. Either a) allow the artist to select between multiple words or 
	b) allow the artist to skip words (either cap the # of skips or add a skip 			penalty like point deduction)
3. Allow game to work over the internet
4. fill bucket tool

==========================================================================================
Bugs To-do:
1. Canvas Bugs
	- If anything is above the canvas, its included in the SS (no fix)
	- The canvas gets cleared but reappears if u click after u minimize the window
	- A tiny part of the previous stroke gets lost when the SS is taken 
	- There is a double stroke (ONLY FOR AHMAD)	¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2. the "type start to..." message appears 2 times. it shows up when you type and enter start

3. Fix player disconnecting issues
    -i.e what happens if artist dips
    -server must reset and stay idle if everyone dips

5. Fix the end of round screen so that it doesn't clip player names/points after a few players

6. If a word has to many letters the letter space holders interfere with other UI elements or go off the screen
 - Limit to MAX 12 letters
