To-do:
4. Fix points system -> bugs
5. Add a screen that displays how many points each player got (screen goes between rounds) --> isnt this already implemented? No I removed it cuz it was shit
6. Display the magic word to the artist in the status bar
9. Use better music
==========================================================================================
Possible To-do:
1. Add host commands (I.e. kicking, restarting game etc)
2. Either a) allow the artist to select between multiple words or 
	b) allow the artist to skip words (either cap the # of skips or add a skip 			penalty like point deduction)
3. Allow game to work over the internet

Bugs To-do:
1. Canvas now works with screenshots but the following bugs have been created:
	-canvas is grey instead of white - this is probably because we're using a transparent bg - shouldnt be necessary anymore right?
    -subtle duplication - the chat panel duplicates itself like 2 pixels to the left - same issue we were getting when we werent refreshing bg
    -when drawing, there is sometimes loss of some drawing components (part of the stroke is lost) - likely happens when taking image
    -image is taken of the screen, not the window - if the windows overlap, or something covers the game window, its included in the screenshot
    -canvas is not cleared at the end of the round
    -reintroduced the issue of drawing outside the canvas (i think solving the other issues might fix this as well)
    -if you move the canvas of players, sometimes it duplicates all the components a couple pixels next to the originals
    -same grey canvas issue as before, if you shake the window, or move it offscreen it clears

3. Fix player disconnecting issues 
    -i.e what happens if artist dips
    -server must reset and stay idle if everyone dips

4.Points system is very unbalanced and has a bug where sometimes it doesn't update somebodies score
    a. shouldn't get points if no one guesses correctly, it could incentivise players to draw nothing at all

5. Fix the end of round screen so that it doesn't clip player names/points after a few players

6. If a word has to many letters the letter space holders interfere with other UI elements or go off the screen
 - Limit to MAX 12 letters
