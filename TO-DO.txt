To-do:
1. Fill bucket tool, I'll do this once the current issue is dealt with
4. Fix points system -> bugs
5. Add a screen that displays how many points each player got (screen goes between rounds) --> isnt this already implemented?
6. Display the magic word to the artist in the status bar
9. Use better music
==========================================================================================
Possible To-do:
1. Add host commands (I.e. kicking, restarting game etc)
2. Either a) allow the artist to select between multiple words or 
	b) allow the artist to skip words (either cap the # of skips or add a skip 			penalty like point deduction)
3. Allow game to work over the internet

==========================================================================================
Bugs To-do:
1. the canvas (which isnt being redrawn until the end of the round) sometimes turns grey.
    a. causes: rapidly moving the window back and forth, and moving the window off the desktop screen (alt-tabbing also causes this)
    b. this also sometimes causes minor duplication of panels, lasts for about a second
    Solution: If we can figure out when this happens, we can redraw the canvasImage and all the components
        - we can check the x,y location of the window to see if its on screen (cause 2)
        - we can check if the window has focus to see if we've alt-tabbed (cause 3)
        - Not sure how to determine if the issue was caused by rapid window movement
            - NOTE: I think this is a windows issue, because rapidly moving a window is like a shortcut to change focus of other windows
        We might have to try and stop if from making the screen grey in the first place, but since idk why thats happening, the previous solution is all ive got rn
    c. To-Do: reset DCdrawn and canvasCleared variables at the end of each round


3. Fix player disconnecting issues 
    -i.e what happens if artist dips
    -server must reset and stay idle if everyone dips

4.Points system is very unbalanced and has a bug where sometimes it doesn't update somebodies score
    a. shouldn't get points if no one guesses correctly, it could incentivise players to draw nothing at all

5. Fix the end of round screen so that it doesn't clip player names/points after a few players

6. If a word has to many letters the letter space holders interfere with other UI elements or go off the screen
 - Limit to MAX 12 letters
