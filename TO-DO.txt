To-do:
1. Add comments to the remainder of panel and player, server, server input and output threads
2. Fix points (you messed up mon negro with the time remaining variable)
3. Make the points between rounds screen look better
4. Add better music 
5. Add an indication next to the artist so its obvious who the artist is (maybe a pencil)
==========================================================================================
Bugs To-do:
1. Canvas Bugs
	- If anything is above the canvas, its included in the SS (no fix)
	- The canvas gets cleared but reappears if u click after u minimize the window
	- A tiny part of the previous stroke gets lost when the SS is taken 
	- There is a double stroke (ONLY FOR AHMAD)	¯\_(ツ)_/¯


2. If a word has to many letters the letter space holders interfere with other UI elements or go off the screen
 - Limit to MAX 12 letters
