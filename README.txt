- Set the proper host name in the client: If the server is on the same computer as the client set the host name in the client to "localhost". If the server is on a different computer, you can get the hostname of that computer by typing "hostname" in the command line. In the client, type the servers hostname followed by ".local"

- Common issues: 
	- The server and client are on different networks
	- Windows defender is preventing the connection 
	- The port number is being used (change port number)
	- Wrong host name typed in client
