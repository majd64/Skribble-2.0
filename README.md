# Skribble 2.0

#### A desktop version of the online game called Skribbl.io. This game uses local networking to allow players on the same network to play against each other. Contains a chatbox for users to communicate, as well as a canvas for the artist to draw on that syncs to all users clients in real-time. 

Uses java's socket programming libraries to connected local computers together. Data is serialized before transmission. Multiple threads are used to support the games processes. The server is hosted on the initial users computer.

This project introduced me to multithreading, networking in general, and the idea of a server and client.
